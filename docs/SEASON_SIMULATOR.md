# Deterministic Season Simulator

M2.5 is implemented by `fantasy_football.season_simulator`. The coordinator is
pure and immutable: it consumes a published canonical schema-v3 snapshot, one
externally supplied deterministic score scenario, explicit transaction and IR
policies, and optional validated consolation configuration. It performs no
network access and generates no random values.

## Public contract

`simulate_deterministic_season()` returns `DeterministicSeasonResult`.
`DeterministicScoreScenario` has a stable caller-supplied ID and an immutable
tuple of `RealizedPlayerScore` records. Score records must reference canonical
players, the canonical season and simulation horizon, have unique player/week
keys, and contain finite values. Zero and negative scores are preserved.
Coverage is checked when a player is actually frozen into an active matchup;
unrelated players need no score. Projections are never substituted for realized
scores.

The result retains initial and final regular-season standings, every completed
weekly transition, transaction diagnostics, frozen lineups and realized team
scores, evolving ownership/availability state, postseason progression, final
team records, and any unresolved capabilities. `complete` means every configured
team has one supported final placement. A disabled or unresolved consolation
format yields a useful but explicitly `incomplete` result rather than invented
nonqualifier ranks.

## Weekly order

For each canonical scoring week the coordinator:

1. Advances the immutable acquisition cycle after the first week. Holds remain
   held; matchup-period counts reset only when the canonical period changes.
2. Applies inverse-standings priority only when canonical
   `waiver_order_resets=True`; persistent priority is preserved when false, and
   unknown reset behavior fails preflight. Each new window freezes its actual
   opening queue independently of later within-window claim movement.
3. Calls the accepted essential-only weekly transaction executor. A materially
   unresolved authorization with a remaining starter vacancy stops with an
   incomplete result; it is not recorded as a no-acquisition decision.
4. Calls M2.1 for every team in an active matchup and freezes the exact
   projection-optimal legal lineup from the resulting modeled roster.
5. Requires realized scores for those starters. M2.2 resolves regular games and
   cumulative standings. M2.4 scores active postseason games, retains
   incomplete multiweek totals, advances brackets, and assigns placements.
6. Retains the complete transition and validates evolving state before moving
   to the next week.

Postseason seeds come only from modeled final regular-season standings. Snapshot
historical seed fields are not used. A deeper unresolved standings tie produces
an incomplete result before bracket initialization.

## Configuration and provenance

League size, participants, slots, schedule phases, matchup periods, round
durations, acquisition limits, waiver behavior and postseason structures come
from the canonical snapshot or an explicitly validated consolation mapping.
The operational transaction path currently supports verified non-budget
traditional waivers only. FAAB, alternative acquisition formats, unresolved
waiver-reset behavior, unsupported reseeding, unresolved odd-ladder continuation
and missing strict-IR evidence fail closed at the narrow affected boundary.

The modeled weekly waiver-processing boundary, projection-based IR recovery and
reverse-initial-priority immediate-free-agent ordering remain named approved V1
assumptions, not ESPN facts. Advancing a week does not release held players or
invent waiver-clearance timestamps.

## Determinism and limitations

Stable identifiers and sorting make results independent of scenario tuple order.
The source snapshot, score scenario and every prior immutable state remain
unchanged. Logical results normalize component timing fields to zero; measured
runtime and memory diagnostics remain external benchmark evidence rather than
values that could make deterministic result equality host-dependent.
M2.5 does not sample outcomes, calculate probabilities, search trades, persist
scenario results, or implement a dashboard.

Credential-free tests include a hand-calculated two-week regular season plus
postseason, exact standings/PF reconciliation, a settings-driven 14-team
1/1/2-week bracket, multiweek championship reversal, exact consolation ranks,
disabled consolation, unresolved transaction authorization, malformed score
inputs, replay determinism and input immutability. The acceptance run passed
110 targeted integration tests and all 440 credential-free repository tests.
Synthetic uninstrumented averages were 14.58 ms for the compact three-week
path, 52.06 ms for the 14-team four-week postseason path, and 19.07 ms for the
compact transaction-active path. `tracemalloc` measured peaks of 337.4 KiB and
220.9 KiB for the compact and 14-team no-acquisition workloads respectively;
instrumentation raised their average runtimes to 394.06 ms and 1,046.41 ms.
